### Smart Contract 
A Smart contract is a self-executing code (agreement)between two or more parties deployed and executed in a distributed ledger platform
### Formal Verification
Static analysis and a maths-based technique are called formal methods to check the system design and its properties. And it contributes to the safety and steadiness of the system as well as the functional correctness of the smart contract
