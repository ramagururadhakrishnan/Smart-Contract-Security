MiningVulnerable

The rules in SmartCheck for the code of the contract "MiningVulnerable" can include:

Checks for the correct usage of require statements to ensure that an address is not already marked as a miner before allowing it to mine, and to check if the address is indeed a miner before allowing it to stop mining.

Checks for the proper update of the totalSupply and balances variables after a successful mine or stop mine operation.

Checks for the correct handling of corner cases, such as attempting to mine or stop mining with insufficient funds or when the address is already marked as a miner or not.

Security checks for potential vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow of variables, and access control issues.

These are just some of the examples, and the actual RDL would depend on the specific requirements and goals of the contract.
