VulnerableDAO

The RDL for this code in SmartCheck could include the following rules:

Require a check for the ownership of the contract before adding new members.
Require a check for the membership status of the sender before transferring funds.
Require proper checks for insufficient funds during transfers.
Ensure that the owner address is properly set during contract deployment.
Ensure that the total supply of the contract is properly initialized during deployment.
Ensure that the balance mapping is properly updated during transfers.
Ensure that the membership mapping is properly updated when adding new members.
Ensure that the input parameters for the transfer function are within the acceptable range.
These are general guidelines for making the contract more secure and can vary based on the specific requirements of the contract.
