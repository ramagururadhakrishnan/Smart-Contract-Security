InadequateAccessControls
To provide a rule defined language (RDL) for this code in the tool "smartcheck", we need to define the security rules we want to enforce.
Here's an example RDL for enforcing the requirement that only the contract's owner can modify the value var

rule InadequateAccessControlsVulnerable_only_owner_can_set_value {
when {
c: ContractCallEvent(c.target == this && c.function == "setValue");
}
then {
require(c.caller == tx.origin.contract, "Only contract owner can set value");
}
}
