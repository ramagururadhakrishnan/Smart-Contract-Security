RDL for this code in SmartCheck can include rules such as:

The invest function should check if the sender is already an investor before adding to their investment balance
The payInterest function should distribute the interest among all investors, not just the sender
The payInterest function should calculate the interest correctly, using the formula interest = totalInvested * interestRate / 100
The withdraw function should not allow the total invested to fall below zero
The contract should have a mechanism to prevent overflow/underflow errors in arithmetic operations
The contract should enforce an upper limit on the investment amount to prevent large investments from draining all the funds.
