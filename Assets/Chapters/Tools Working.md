### Manticore  
Manticore is an open-source symbolic execution tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It uses symbolic execution and fuzz testing to detect a wide range of security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
Manticore can detect a variety of security issues, such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, and unhandled exceptions. It can also detect vulnerabilities related to contract creation and inheritance, and vulnerabilities related to the use of external contracts and libraries.
The tool works by analyzing the bytecode of a smart contract and simulating the execution of the code, to detect potential vulnerabilities. It uses a technique called symbolic execution, which represents the input and output of a program as symbolic variables and uses a constraint solver to explore the possible execution paths of the code.
Manticore can detect vulnerabilities by analyzing the control flow and data dependencies of the contract, and it can also detect vulnerabilities by injecting random input into the contract and observing the behavior of the contract.

### SmartCheck 
SmartCheck is an online security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It uses static code analysis to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
SmartCheck can detect a wide range of security issues, such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, and unhandled exceptions. It can also detect potential issues related to contract creation, contract inheritance and the use of external contracts and libraries.
The tool works by analyzing the bytecode or the source code of a smart contract, to detect potential vulnerabilities. It uses a set of predefined rules and heuristics to identify potential vulnerabilities and also it uses machine learning algorithms to detect complex issues that are not covered by the predefined rules.

### Certora 
Certora is a smart contract verification platform that uses formal verification techniques to analyze and prove the correctness of smart contracts. It uses static code analysis, symbolic execution, and theorem proving to detect a wide range of security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
Certora can detect a variety of security issues, such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, and unhandled exceptions. It can also detect potential issues related to contract creation, contract inheritance and the use of external contracts and libraries.
The tool works by analyzing the bytecode or the source code of a smart contract, to detect potential vulnerabilities. It uses formal methods to prove the correctness of the smart contract and identify potential errors. It also uses symbolic execution and theorem proving to check for possible attacks and vulnerabilities.

### HoneyBadger 
HoneyBadger is a tool that allows for automated formal verification of smart contracts written in Solidity. It uses formal methods to analyze smart contracts and prove the correctness of the smart contract's behavior. It also aims to detect potential vulnerabilities and bugs in the smart contract.
HoneyBadger uses several techniques for its analysis, such as symbolic execution, model checking and automated theorem proving. It also uses a library of pre-defined properties that can be used to prove the correctness of smart contracts and detect possible vulnerabilities.
The tool can be used to verify properties of a smart contract such as:
Proper handling of user input
Proper handling of external calls
Proper handling of return values
Proper handling of errors
Proper handling of Ether
Proper handling of time-dependency.

### Slither 
Slither is an open-source security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It uses a combination of static code analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzz testing to detect a wide range of security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
Slither can detect a variety of security issues, such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, and unhandled exceptions. It can also detect potential issues related to contract creation, contract inheritance, and the use of external contracts and libraries. It can detect issues related to the use of certain solidity functions and libraries, such as the use of the call or delegatecall functions, or the use of the address.transfer function. It also can detect issues related to the use of the selfdestruct function, and the use of the tx.origin variable.
Slither works by analyzing the bytecode of a smart contract, and generates a control flow graph that represents the contract's execution. It then uses this control flow graph to detect potential vulnerabilities by analyzing the control flow and data dependencies of the contract. It also uses symbolic execution and fuzz testing to detect vulnerabilities that are not easily detected by static analysis.
