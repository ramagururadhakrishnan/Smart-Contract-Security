#### Types of Attacks 
### Reentrancy attacks
These attacks exploit the ability of a contract to call external contracts, allowing an attacker to repeatedly call a function in the target contract and extract value.

### Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
These attacks aim to overload a contract with a large number of transactions or function calls, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

### Integer overflow/underflow
These attacks exploit the fact that integers in smart contracts can only represent a limited range of values, allowing an attacker to cause unexpected behavior by causing an integer to overflow or underflow.

### Transaction-ordering dependency
These attacks allow an attacker to change the order of transactions in a block and cause unexpected behavior.

### Front running
These attacks exploit the fact that smart contracts execute on a public blockchain, allowing an attacker to observe and act on the same information as other users, such as observing a pending transaction and executing a conflicting transaction before it can be processed.

### Phishing
These attacks attempt to trick users into sending funds to a malicious contract by disguising it as a legitimate contract.

### Inadequate access controls
These attacks exploit weak or missing access controls in contracts, allowing an attacker to execute privileged functions or steal assets.

### Insecure randomness
These attacks exploit the use of predictable or biased randomness in contracts, allowing an attacker to predict or manipulate the outcome of certain functions.
