### ProcessAlgebras:Process algebra is a family of mathematical approaches used to describe the behaviors of distributed or parallel systems in the form of interacting concurrent processes. The observable behaviors of a smart contract are similar to that of a shared-memory concurrent program  or a system with an interleaving mode , which makes process algebra a suitable candidate for high-level behavioral modeling. Therefore, process algebra captures the interactions between concurrently acting users and one or several interconnected smart contracts. For these interactions, correctness can be assured through a translation of a smart contract to one of the process-algebraic formalisms. An alternative approach involves implementation of a smart contract in a process-algebraic domain-specific language (DSL).
